# Gravity Rhythm Synth 🌙

**Gravity Rhythm Synth** is a generative sound instrument that combines  
a physics engine with the Web Audio API.

A bouncing ball, gravity, and wall collisions directly influence  
pitch, rhythm, delay, and texture, creating an evolving and  
unrepeatable musical experience.

This instrument does not play pre-written patterns —  
it *emerges* from motion.

## Features

- Physics simulation powered by **Matter.js**
- Polyphonic synthesizer using **Web Audio API**
- Wall-collision–triggered generative notes
- Toggle-based **Key** and **Waveform** selectors
- Delay feedback changes triggered by wall collisions
- Oscilloscope, FFT spectrum, and XY (Lissajous) visualizations
- Fully generative and non-deterministic sound behavior

## How to Play

1. **START**  
   Starts the simulation and kicks the ball in a random direction

2. **KICK / Space Key**  
   Applies a random impulse to the ball

3. **KEY Buttons (C–B)**  
   Only enabled keys can be triggered on wall collisions  
   Active notes are visually highlighted

4. **Waveform Buttons**  
   A random enabled waveform is selected on each trigger  
   Waveforms currently in use are visually indicated

5. **Envelope / Delay / Physics Controls**  
   Shape both motion and sound behavior
